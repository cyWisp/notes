    <body><div class='page'><h1 class='title'>More on CentOS</h1><br/>The CentOS Linux distribution is a stable, predictable, manageable, and reproducible platform derived from the sources of RHEL. CentOS is maintained by the CentOS Project, a community-driven free software effort that has its own governing board. The members of the CentOS Project work independently of the RHEL team. However, CentOS benefits from Red Hat&#39;s ongoing contributions and investment, and the CentOS trademark is owned by Red Hat.<br /><br />This course uses CentOS because it provides a free enterprise-class computing platform that aims to be functionally compatible with the upstream product (RHEL) that it derives from. CentOS does not contain Red Hat&#39;s product or certifications, although it is build from the same sources as the upstream enterprise products. More details about this are available in the CentOS FAQ here:<br /><br /><a href="https://wiki.centos.org/FAQ/General">https://wiki.centos.org/FAQ/General</a><br /><br />For production environments, the licensed and fully supported RHEL produt is recommended.<br /><br /></div></body></html>
