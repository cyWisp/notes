    <body><div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Linux Distributions</h1><br/>As a family of operating systems, there is no official OS called “Linux.” Instead, there are distinct members of the family called <strong>Linux distributions</strong>, or <strong>distros</strong>. All Linux distros are based on the Linux kernel; they differ primarily in what additional software they add on top of the kernel to create a fully functional OS, as well as the version of the kernel they run. There are also differences in community, rate of release, and other factors. Choosing a distribution is a matter of identifying which one more closely aligns with your business needs as well as your familiarity with its tools.<br /></div></body></html>
