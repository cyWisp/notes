    <body><div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Free Software VS Open Source Software</h1><br/><strong>Free software VS Open Source Software<br /></strong><br />The term <strong>free software</strong> is often used interchangeably with OSS, and both share a great deal of overlap. However, some draw a distinction between the two. Richard Stallman, the founder of the free software movement, argues that the the terms share different values - in his words, “Open source is a development methodology; free softare is a social movement.” In other words, OSS is most concerned with fostering open collaboration, whereas free software is most concerned with upholding users&#39; rights. Note that “free” is being used in the sense of freedom, not in the sense of having no monetary cost.<br /><br />In an attempt to resolve this terminology dispute, some developers have adopted the term <strong>free and open source software (FOSS)</strong> to describe any project that emobdies the values of both movements.<br /><br /><a href=""><img src="images/115-1.png" alt="images/115-1.png" /></a><br /><br />A Venn disgram of free software and open source software.<br /><br /></div></body></html>
