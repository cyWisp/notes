    <body><div class='page'><h1 class='title'>GNU Linux</h1><br/>Because most members of the Linux OS family incorporate GNU utilities along with the Linux kenerl, the FSF prefers to call the OS family “GNU/Linux” rather than just “Linux.” This supports the idea that the Linux kernel was the “missing piece” to the GNU Project, and gives credit to GNU for its tools and the free software movement itself. However, Torvalds and others disagree with this assessment, and the name “Linux” is by far the most common way of referring to the OS family.</div></body></html>
