Users are granted these rights when the author of the software releases the source code under one of several open source licenses. The opposite of OSS is proprietary software - software that is released under a license that imposes rectrictions on one or more of the rights just mentioned (view, copy, modify, ditribute).<br /><br />OSS provides several advantages to users, administrators and programmers alike. Perhaps te most important element of OSS is that it encourages the ongoing development of software in a collaborative, community-driven environment. Individuals or groups of developers may build ipon another developer&#39;s work to create enhanced or customized software, all while avoiding legal issues. There are many examples of OSS, one of which is the Linux kernel.<br /><br /><br /><a href=""><img src="images/114-1.png" alt="images/114-1.png" /></a><br /><br />The fundamental permissions granted by open source software.</div></body></html>
