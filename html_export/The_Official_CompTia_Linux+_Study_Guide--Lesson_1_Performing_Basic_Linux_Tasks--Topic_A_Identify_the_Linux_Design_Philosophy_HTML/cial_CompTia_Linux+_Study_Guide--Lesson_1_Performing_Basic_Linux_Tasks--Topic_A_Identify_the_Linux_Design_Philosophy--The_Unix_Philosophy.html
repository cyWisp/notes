    <body><div class='page'><h1 class='title'>The Unix Philosophy</h1><br/>Because GNU software is based on the design of Unix, it tends to conform to the Unix philosophy. The <strong>Unix Philosophy</strong> is a set of best practices and approaches to software development that emphasize simplicity and modularity. This philosophy was created by the lead developers of the Unix operating system and has been summarized in many ways. Some of the key high-level points include:<br /><br />• <strong>Do one thing and do it well</strong>. Rather than writing a monolithic software tool that accomplishes a variety of disparate tasks, write individual tools that fulfill a specific function.<br />• <strong>Worse is better</strong>. Software that is limited in functionality (&quot;worse&quot;) is often preferable (&quot;better&quot;) because it tends to be easier to use and maintain.<br />• <strong>Support interactivity</strong>. Write individual tools so that they work well with other tools.<br />• <strong>Handle input/output streams</strong>. Feeding one tool&#39;s output as input to another tool is a universally desirable feature.<br /><br /></div></body></html>
