    <body><div class='page'><h1 class='title'>The GNU Project</h1><br/>The <strong>GNU Project</strong> is a free software project led by Richard Stallman. Announced in 1983, it was the first project of its kind, and effectively launched the free software movement. The GNU Project&#39;s goal is to create an operating system that is composed of entirely free software. By the early 1990s, the GNU Project had not completed a full OS, but had created several programs. Stallman wrote much of the GNU software himself, including the GNU C Compiler (GCC) and the Emacs text editor. Later, several programmers worked together to develop more utilities that are compatible wth GNU software.<br /><br />Stallman chose the recursive acronym “GNU&#39;s not Unix” to show that GNU software was smiliar in design to the proprietary Unix operating system, but did not actually contain any Unix code.<br /><br /><strong>Note:</strong> The “G” in GNU is included in the pronounciation of the term “guh-NOO”.<br /><br /><br /></div></body></html>
